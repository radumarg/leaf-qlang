### Function Effects

Function effects are annotations needed by the compiler (type checker specifically) to reason about Leaf code. The function effects form a lattice:

```leaf
classical < uncompsafe < unitary < general
```

- `classical` is the default effect used to label strictly classical functions i.e. function that do not have qubit arguments and do not perform any quantum operations like `qubit` generation or operations on qubits. The `classical` keyword is optional and is mainly used for generating explicit API specification:

```leaf
classical fn parity (x : u32) -> bool { ... }
```

- Automatic [uncomputation](defining-terms.md#what-uncomputation-means) works when the computation of the temporary value can be described classically. The `uncompsafe` effect is used to annotate functions containing strictly unitary quantum operations that do not generate or destroy entanglement. These basis-preserving quantum gates are used to generate circuits whose effects can be uncomputed automatically such that the ancilla qubits can be subsequently discarded safely:

```leaf
uncompsafe fn oracle (ancillas : [qubit; 3]) -> [qubit; 3] { ... }
```

- `unitary` is used to label function containing unitary quantum gates or invoking `unitary` functions:
 
```leaf
unitary fn grover (qubits : [qubit; 7]) -> [qubit; 7] { ... }
```

- `general` is used to label function which in addition to quantum gates contain `measr`, `reset` or `discard` operations or are invoking `general` functions.

```leaf
general fn sample (qs : [qubit; 7]) -> [bit; 7] { ... }
```
