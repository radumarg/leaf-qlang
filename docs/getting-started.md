### Starting point:

Leaf is deliberately designed to replicate Rust’s basic syntax, with minimal extensions for quantum programming. It follows Rust’s philosophy of strong static type support and extends it to quantum operations.

More precisely, Leaf is intended to be a statically typed, sound, and safe language, meaning that types are checked by the compiler before execution; well-typed programs come with formal guarantees that they behave according to the language’s semantics, without undefined behavior, type-related execution errors, or attempts to perform unphysical quantum operations; and bad runtime behaviors are ruled out by the type system or, where necessary, by runtime checks.

### The lifecycle of Leaf code:

- Frontend: Rust-like surface syntax.
- Type checker: Silq-inspired typing for quantum programming, optional automatic uncomputation.
- First compiler pass: translation to a typed high-level IR.
- High-level IR: based on lambda calculus/quantum lambda calculus.
- Second compiler pass: translation to the Idris2 DSL.
- Idris2 DSL: low-level IR.
- Third compiler pass: serialization of the low-level IR.
- Backend target: OpenQASM 3 for now, with QIR to be added later.

### Leaf will provide strong support for formal verification:

- Type safety ensured by a strong static type system at both the surface-syntax level and the typed high-level IR, with extensive coverage of quantum operations and their constraints.
- Semantic correctness of the algorithm implementation: proved over the high-level IR representation using Lean.
- Correctness of language lowering: the translations to the Idris DSL and subsequently to OpenQASM3/QIR preserve the semantics of the high-level IR.
- The Idris2 DSL, which serves as a low-level IR, does not enforce a full typing discipline, but it is equipped with correctness guarantees expressed using Idris2’s dependent type system and builtin-in proof support, ensuring that qubit indices used in gate applications are valid, control qubits are distinct from target qubits, and all control/target qubits are pairwise distinct when multiple qubits are involved.
